E-Portfolio: Web development with Django

My e-portfolio will be about Django - a web framework for creating web applications with Python. In my presentation I will go through the following topics:
- What is Django?
- How to install/use Django
- Starting a Django project and application
- The MVC pattern
- Creating views and templates
- Using database models
- Managing the application as an admin user

In order to explain all of these things, I will be creating a task tracker/to-do app. You can find the GitHub repository following this link: https://github.com/fgervasi-cell/Django-E-Portfolio.

IMPORTANT!
If you want to follow along or try out the project for yourself you need to
- install Python from https://www.python.org/
- run python -m pip install django to install Django (you can refer to the Django documentation for that step: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
